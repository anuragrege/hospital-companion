      <h2>Scenario Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In an emergency, an electric ambulance equipped with integrated healthcare monitoring, energy management, and
        smart transport capabilities is dispatched to assist a cardiac arrest patient. This system ensures real-time
        patient monitoring, efficient battery usage, and optimized routing, delivering sustainable and rapid emergency
        care.

      <h2>Simulation and Real-World Application</h2>
      <p>
        In the simulation, ECG and SpO₂ sensors provided real-time health data to the EMS, which triggered the
        defibrillator or oxygen system as needed. Battery and current sensors helped adjust speed and power consumption
        to ensure the ambulance reached the hospital. Traffic and GPS sensors dynamically adjusted the route.
        Regenerative braking recovered energy during deceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This simulation demonstrates how integrated systems can balance energy, transport, and medical needs in real
        time, and serves as a model for scalable solutions in smart city infrastructures.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Integrated Scenario in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        In high-demand scenarios with multiple ambulances, each vehicle uses its EMS and routing systems to reduce
        energy waste and optimize patient care. Lighting and HVAC systems are throttled when battery levels are low,
        while medical devices remain fully operational. Traffic-aware routing ensures each patient reaches the hospital
        as quickly as possible, even during grid congestion.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This integrated healthcare, energy, and transport system represents a future-ready approach to emergency
        response. It offers a sustainable, intelligent, and life-saving framework that prioritizes patient health,
        battery efficiency, and rapid transport.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is scalable and suitable for integration with smart grid technologies and municipal traffic systems,
        delivering advanced care without compromising environmental goals or operational efficiency.
