JavaScript Logic
1.	Map Initialization
o	The map is initialized using Leaflet.js and set to display Teynampet, Chennai, with a zoom level of 16.
o	A tile layer from OpenStreetMap is added to the map.
2.	Vehicle Position Generation
o	Random vehicle positions are generated within a bounding box around Teynampet (defined by latitudes and longitudes).
o	10 vehicles are randomly placed within this area, and blue circle markers are added to represent each vehicle on the map.
3.	Communication Simulation
o	The code simulates communication between the vehicles based on their distance. If the distance between two vehicles is within a specified communication range (1000 meters), a communication line is drawn between them.
o	Green lines represent successful communication (90% success rate), while red lines represent unsuccessful communication (10% failure rate).
o	The number of packets sent and received is tracked.
4.	Vehicle Movement Simulation
o	Vehicles are animated to move randomly within the map's defined area (by adjusting their latitude and longitude every second).
o	The vehicle markers update their positions accordingly on the map.
o	After each update in position, the code re-simulates the communication between vehicles.
5.	Button Interactions
o	The Start Simulation button triggers the simulation when clicked:
	The button is disabled and text changes to "Simulation Running..."
	After 10 iterations (one iteration is every second), the simulation stops, and the button is re-enabled with its original text.
	Vehicle positions and communication lines are reset each time the simulation starts.
6.	Legend Box
o	The legend box visually explains what each color represents:
	Blue for vehicles.
	Green for successful communication.
	Red for failed communication.
Key Points
•	Leaflet.js is used to display the map and handle the markers.
•	Turf.js is used to calculate the distance between the vehicles and determine whether communication is possible.
•	D3.js is imported (though not used in the code), which is a popular JavaScript library for data-driven visualizations.
•	The simulation consists of random movement of vehicles and communication attempts based on their proximity to one another.
This type of simulation could be useful for testing network protocols, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, or similar scenarios where communication success is influenced by geographic distances.





Algorithm 
1. Initialize the map:
   - Set map center to a given latitude and longitude
   - Set map zoom level
   - Add tile layer to map

2. Define simulation parameters:
   - comms_range = communication range (in meters)
   - min_lat, min_lng, max_lat, max_lng = geographical boundaries for vehicle positions
   - num_vehicles = number of vehicles to simulate
   - vehicle_positions = array to store positions of vehicles
   - vehicle_markers = array to store markers for vehicles on the map
   - comm_lines = array to store communication lines (successful or unsuccessful)
   - total_packets_sent = counter for total number of packets sent
   - total_packets_received = counter for total number of packets received
   - iterations = counter for simulation steps

3. Generate random positions for vehicles:
   FOR each vehicle index from 0 to num_vehicles - 1:
     - Generate a random latitude between min_lat and max_lat
     - Generate a random longitude between min_lng and max_lng
     - Add the new random position to vehicle_positions array
     - Create a map marker at the generated position and add it to vehicle_markers

4. Define simulate_communication function:
   - Remove any previous communication lines from the map
   - Loop through each unique pair of vehicles (i, j):
     - Calculate the distance between vehicle i and vehicle j using geographic distance function
     - Increment total_packets_sent
     - IF distance between vehicles i and j is within comms_range:
       - Generate a random value to determine success rate (e.g., 90% success rate)
       - IF communication is successful:
         - Draw a line (green) between vehicle i and vehicle j
         - Increment total_packets_received
       ELSE:
         - Draw a line (red) between vehicle i and vehicle j

5. Define animate_vehicles function:
   - Loop through each vehicle index:
     - Update vehicle's latitude and longitude by a small random amount to simulate movement
     - Update vehicle marker position on the map based on the new coordinates
   - Call simulate_communication function to check communication after vehicles have moved
   - Increment iteration counter
   - IF iterations < maximum_iterations:
     - Wait for 1 second before calling animate_vehicles function again
   ELSE:
     - Log simulation completion
     - Re-enable the start button and reset its text

6. Define button click event for Start Simulation:
   - Remove any existing communication lines from the map
   - Clear current vehicle positions and markers from the map
   - Regenerate random vehicle positions
   - Recreate markers for the new vehicle positions
   - Disable the start button and change its text to "Simulation Running..."
   - Reset iteration counter
   - Start the simulation by calling animate_vehicles function
7. Add interaction to the simulation:
   - When the "Start Simulation" button is clicked:
     - Begin the simulation by animating vehicles, updating their positions, and simulating communication
   - After a set number of iterations, stop the simulation and re-enable the start button
WHY I CHOSE THESE PROTOCOLS ONLY AND NOT TRADITIONAL METHODS
In choosing CV2X with 5G as the communication protocol for vehicular networks, I opted for it over traditional IoT communication protocols like MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee, or even VANET, due to its comprehensive advantages in multiple key areas, including security, range, reliability, and scalability.
One of the most compelling reasons for this choice is security. Vehicular networks are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks, and ensuring secure communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians is critical. CV2X, when integrated with 5G, provides robust security features such as end-to-end encryption, authentication, and privacy protection, which are baked into the cellular network itself. This level of security is far superior to most traditional IoT protocols like MQTT or CoAP, which were not specifically designed for high-risk environments like vehicular communication. Protocols like MQTT, which are widely used in IoT, do not inherently include advanced security features, leaving them susceptible to potential breaches or attacks in critical applications.
Another major factor is the range and reliability of CV2X with 5G. While traditional IoT protocols like Zigbee or even VANETs are optimized for short-range communication and are typically limited by network infrastructure, CV2X with 5G leverages the advanced cellular network infrastructure that offers extensive coverage, even in rural or remote areas. This extended range allows vehicles to communicate over much longer distances, which is crucial for applications like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication. Moreover, CV2X with 5G benefits from the reliability of 5G’s low latency and high throughput, ensuring real-time, seamless communication for time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving or emergency vehicle notification, which would not be achievable with most traditional IoT protocols.
Beyond security and range, latency and real-time communication are paramount in vehicular networks. The low latency of CV2X with 5G is a significant advantage over other protocols like MQTT or even more traditional protocols used in IoT. In autonomous vehicles, for instance, communication needs to occur in milliseconds, and any delay could result in dangerous consequences. CV2X with 5G supports ultra-low latency, enabling fast, near-instantaneous decision-making and communication between vehicles and infrastructure, something traditional IoT protocols typically struggle with due to slower communication speeds.
Furthermore, scalability is another key factor. As more vehicles and devices become connected, the volume of data and the number of devices participating in the network will grow exponentially. CV2X with 5G is specifically designed to handle large-scale, high-density networks, something that traditional IoT communication protocols like MQTT and Zigbee are not optimized for. For instance, while protocols like MQTT are lightweight and efficient for small-scale IoT networks, they do not perform as well in large, dynamic environments such as vehicular networks where hundreds or thousands of devices may need to communicate in real time.
Additionally, network efficiency and Quality of Service (QoS) provided by CV2X with 5G are far superior. 5G networks are designed to provide a guaranteed level of service, prioritizing critical communications (like safety messages between vehicles) over less critical ones, thus ensuring that the most important data gets through even during periods of network congestion. Traditional IoT protocols, on the other hand, typically do not have such mechanisms in place and can suffer from packet loss or delays in more crowded environments.
Finally, mobility support is essential for vehicular communication systems, and CV2X with 5G excels here as well. Traditional IoT protocols like Zigbee or Wi-Fi were designed primarily for static networks, and while VANETs are more mobile, they still lack the advanced handoff and mobility management features that CV2X with 5G offers. As vehicles are constantly moving, the protocol must ensure continuous connectivity and smooth handover between cells, which is a strength of 5G technology.
In conclusion, CV2X with 5G is the ideal choice for vehicular communication because it not only offers advanced security, extended range, and low latency, but also provides scalability, network efficiency, real-time communication, and support for mobility. These characteristics make it far superior to traditional IoT protocols, which were not specifically designed for the complex, high-speed, and high-risk environment of vehicular networks. The combination of these factors ensures that CV2X with 5G is well-equipped to meet the demands of future intelligent transportation systems, enabling safer, more reliable, and efficient vehicle communication.
